# Arduino-Board
## Week One
I was not here but I heard that it was mostly explaining of the boards and what to do and not many people got anything to work
## Week Two
I started of not knowing anything. I was really confused and I was not sure what I needed to do.
I have been told that we needed to get the red light to blink and somehow we did it.
## Week Three
This week we did a lot! At the start we did not know what we were doing 
but after a really long time of troubleshooting we were able to get the board to work.

Our problem was that we did not push the code into the right port and we also didn't have the right board setup in the software
## Week Four
